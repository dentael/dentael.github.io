                <h1>Field of Application</h1>
                <p>This retainer is used after orthodontic treatments and generally for keeping the tooth 
                    in their present place. In some cases we can replace missing tooth on temporary basis. 
                    The retainer is recommended for daily use not for the night. These retainers are not for hard bite 
                    relaxing. It is forbidden to eat in it. 
                    <br> Application:
                    The material is slightly flexible but thin to be comfortable for wearing it whole day. 
                    It means that insertion of placing is really important and must follow the instructions.                
                </p>

                <h1>Instructions for cleaning and maintenance</h1>
                <p>After use:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wash well with water.</li>
                        <li>Best is to throughly clean the inner and exterior side of the retainer with a tooth 
                            brush and soap. 
                            Do not use any strongly perfumed soaps. Not suited are: tooth-paste 
                            (contains abrasive particles), mouth-wash (can cause discolouring) 
                            and water that is hotter than 50Â°C (deformation). 
                            Solvent-based cleaning agents cause delamination of multi-layered 
                            splints.</li>
                        <li>Again, wash well with water.</li>
                        <li>Shake off the water or dry with a towel.</li>
                        <li>Never blow-dry - deformation!</li>
                        <li>Very important: Allow the retainer to completely dry! 
                            Keep at a dry place, at best in a box like that has aeration holes.</li>
                        <li>Again wash with water before using it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

                <h1>Discolouring and bad smells</h1>
                <p>Thermoforming materials have the tendency to discolour. 
                    This intake of colour pigments can be reduced or avoided by careful 
                    maintenance, but it cannot be reversed. Mouth-washes and amalgam fillings 
                    can also cause discolouring. 
                    <br>If after some time the splint has adopted a strong smell, additionally 
                    put the splint for one hour in a non-perfumed, concentrated soap solution, 
                    afterwards thoroughly wash with water. Such soap suds remove most of the 
                    smell generating bacteria. </p>
